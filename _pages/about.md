I'm a second-year PhD student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), supervised by [Prof.Xiaoyao Liang](https://acalab.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [Prof.Zhuoran Song](https://songzhuoran.github.io/). My research focuses on Computer Architecture, specifically graph processing and graph neural networks (GNNs). I have also conducted research on optimizing sparse matrix multiplication and improving irregular access through prefetching techniques.
